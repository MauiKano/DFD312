# DFD312
Firmware for the eStim MK312BT hardware
The MK312 project has delivered a nicely documented and complete hardware desctiption for building a eStim device inspired by the famous ET312. Firmware in binary format exists and works. This allows the community to build such devices. Great work. I did miss however possibility to change the firmware, extend and modify it. I could not find anything on the Internet about this so I dicided to write it on my own. This repository contains all files needed to compile the firmware and load it to a MK312-BT hardware. It works with the Arduino IDE and is simply structured. Functionality is beeing increased over time. At the time of the first release the basic functionality of the MK312 firmware is implemented. 
- Complete menu user interface identical to MK312
- Basic stimmulation pattern (wave, stroke ..)

Missing so far is:
- Audio patterns
- remote link / blue tooth
- Phase patterns
